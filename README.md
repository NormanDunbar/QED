# QED
QED is a compact and fast text editor for the Sinclair QL, written in 68000 Assembly in 1988. The source code is from version 1.01, a binary of v1.02c is included with some enhancements like support for TK2 default directories.
The most recent source code is at version 2.00 beta which I will publish shortly in a separate branch, since this version is yet unstable.
