# QED
QED is a compact and fast text editor for the Sinclair QL, written in 68000 Assembly. Originally released in 1988, work continued on a v2.xx version until 1994 but was never publicly released.

This is the most recent version 2.00 beta which includes several enhancements like auto-indent, TK2 default directories and editing multiple files simultaneously. A word of warning - this is a beta version and buggy in some respects - please read the Issues section for details. In particular, note that the QEDCONFIG_BAS configuration program still needs to be updated to support this version (see QED_ASM for updated info on configuration data).
